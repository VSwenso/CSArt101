					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The only real challenge I was having was with the first task on the console.
						i was super confused about how to declare an array, so i ended up watching a bunch
						of youtube tutorials until it was able to end up working. the main problem i kept on 
						running into was saying that there was an error whenever i tried to make the list. 
						i talked to my partner about this and we were able to get it working. I am very VERY 
						grateful for his input.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> There werent actually a lot of problems, every task was kinda straight forward,
						except for the issues i had with the first one. We ended up sailing through it at a pretty 
						nice pace.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I thought we did a good job on this assignemnt, it took me a bit of effort to try and figure out my 
						problem with the first task, but we were able to get through it. I think i put a good amount of effort into 
						this lab with the picture formatting and design in the background as well.

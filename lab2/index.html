					<h2>challenges</h2>
					<p>One of the main challenges for us was being able to correctly line up the text box for the CSS section
						We ended up trying to google it but it definely was one of the major chalenges we faced.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Same thing as prior, it was the problem of being able to line up the text box/border properly. 
						we tried to fix it by just disussing with each other what er thought was wrong but we ended up needing to find our answers on google. 
						it took some time but we were eventually able to figure out the reason for the problem and then amend the issue. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I thought this project went by somewhat smoothly we didnt really face much hiccups besides the border. 
						I really loved working with my partner Andres, they were very fun to talk to and we had a lot of the same interests. 
						we started off the assignment by doing the class reading, through that we were able to incorperate this into our own colaberation. 
						our energy was mainly focused on how to approach this lab in a fun and learing sort of manor. </p>

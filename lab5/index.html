					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the Lab was to experiment with basic Javascript data types and variables, 
						plus to apply the stuff we learned in class to our own code.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For the most part we didnt really run into any major problems. Execpt for a minor
						hiccup in Task 3. But it wasnt a huge issue so much as "oh this task is more
						difficult than the previous ones lets give it some extra love and attention" plus 
						we had to make sure that our javascript was able to be properl linked and stuff.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I really enjoyed this lab, before we started working on it my roomate told me that 
						there were free pretzels at Wetzels Pretzels today so Andres and I met up at the 
						capitola mall and got some pretzels first. Once we got back we started working on it
						since the lab was sort of straight forward we mainly talked to each other rather than 
						like code and stuff. we only ever really talked about it when we needed help with a line
						of code or we were just talking about the general overview of it. All in all i had a 
						great time. :3 </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The Challenge of this lab was to visit previous labs and then debug any that may or may
						not have problems. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2> Problems</h2>
					<p> we didnt run into any problems. it was mainly just realizing a lil hiccup i made previously.
						  </p>

				border: solid rgb(238, 11, 11) 3px; padding: 2px"/>
				<p>This is the part of Lab 10 that i will be fixing. In the final output of my name 
					sorting code it had printed commas in-between the newly sorted letters. 
				</p>

				<p>This is the newly updated Javascript. The only thing i was missing. was '' in in-between
					the brackets for join -> join('')..... below is the final result of the changes and how it 
					pops up in the browser.

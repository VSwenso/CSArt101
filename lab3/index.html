					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>the challenge of the lab is to add a selfie and embed it into the HTML,
						also to create a bulleted list of the previous and future labs we will be doing. 
						after that you should view it in the browser and test the files locally.
						for some bonus points you can add a CSS style sheet to your homepage. 
					</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main issues i had were trying to get my image to format properly
						it was absoluetly massive and even though i added code and was editing that it never seemed to apply when i saved changes and pushed it. 
						i ended up looking it up on google to try and fix it. another issue i had was with the bulleted list. 
						i dont know why but it just seemed super confusing to me.  
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I thought i did a good job with this lab, i did a lot more problem solving than i have previously on other projects, 
						i spent more time looking stuff up and tring to apply it properly onto my code. but i will say i leanred a lot. 
						my partner also did a good job teaching me and guiding me through some of m issues.  </p>

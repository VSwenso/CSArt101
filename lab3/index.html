					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>the challenge of the lab is to add a selfie and embed it into the HTML,
						also to create a bulleted list of the previous and future labs we will be doing. 
						after that you should view it in the browser and test the files locally.
						for some bonus points you can add a CSS style sheet to your homepage.

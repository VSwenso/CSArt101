					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The main problem I was having with this lab was being able to create new 
						css, javascript, and index.html files. Although i had no problem being able to 
						link it to my Art101 folder. 
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> As previously stated the problems i had were mainly creating new css, javascript and 
						index.html files. My partner was able to help me overcome this issue however. then the 
						next problem i had was not with the code but my human error. this is the 3rd time
						i have written this paragraph, my computer reset my code when i went to take a sc, so 
						thats about it so far. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Well everything on my page is working all Hunky Dory, so all is well. My patner and i 
						put a lot of effort and working into this lab to make sure everything was working and 
						running properly. Absolutely took more work than the previous labs.  </p>

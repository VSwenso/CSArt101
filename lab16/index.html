					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The Challenge of this lab was to experiment with processing JSON from an Api.  
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2> Problems</h2>
					<p> we had a massive problem trying to get the Api linked in the assignment (task 2) to work. We struggled
						with the structure and format of it all until we eventually went to choose a different API from 
						the ones Wes used as examples during class.

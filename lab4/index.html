			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding a Simple Computer Game</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<p>
				Going to the first day of class: <br>
				 1- wake up on time before class <br>
				 2- get dressed <br>
				 3- pack backpack <br> 
				 4- check where your class is <br>
				 5- look at schedule for time and loctaion <br> 
				 6- check estimated travel time from house to class <br>
				 7- leave the house with enough time to make it to class. <br>
				 8- find parking <br>
				 9- walk the rest of the way to class <br>
				 10- find a seat <br>
				 11- await instruction <br>
				  </p>
				<p>
				Pseudocoding Rock-Paper-Sccissors: <br>
				1. player one picks between Rock Paper or Scissors <br>
				2. Player two picks between Rock Paper or Scissors <br>
				3. on the count of three the players reveal their shapes. <br>
				4. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock <br>
				5. If both players make the same shape, it is a tie and the game is repeated or played again. <br>
				</p>
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The Challenge of the lab was to create a list of high level tasks to then use when constructing 
						pseudocode. the main challenge Andres and I faced where with moving our psuedocode for Rock Paper Scissors
						into our html file. it was the indentation that threw us off. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>our main problem as stated above was the indentation of our pseudocode. We fixed this by talking together. 
						he gave me the br tag to indent the list i had in the beginning so that ended up helping a lot. then
						it was just a matter of the task 4 and its indenting that we spent a bit more time working on.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall i really liked this assignment, it helped me to understand pseudocoding pretty easily. 
						And thats syaing a lot since my comprehension level is terrible when it comes to computers. But
						i really liked being able to talk about what task goes in which order and then how to later develop 
						my pseudocoding. As far as effort goes. I think the two of us put in a good amount of effort. We actually 
						brainstormed around 3 different everyday tasks for the first step. At first it was How to make ratatouille, 
						then how to take a dump, then taking the bus, and then finally How to get to the first day of class. 
						Plus i also wanted to jazz up the background a little bit along with the font and such :3 </p>
